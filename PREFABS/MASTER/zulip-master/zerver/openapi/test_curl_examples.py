Error verifying the success of the API documentation curl example.

File: {file_name}
Line: {line}
Curl command:
{curl_command}
Response:
{response}

This test is designed to check each generate_code_example(curl) instance in the
API documentation for success. If this fails then it means that the curl example
that was generated was faulty and when tried, it resulted in an unsuccessful
response.

Common reasons for why this could occur:
    1. One or more example values in zerver/openapi/zulip.yaml for this endpoint
       do not line up with the values in the test database.
    2. One or more mandatory parameters were included in the "exclude" list.

To learn more about the test itself, see zerver/openapi/test_curl_examples.py.
