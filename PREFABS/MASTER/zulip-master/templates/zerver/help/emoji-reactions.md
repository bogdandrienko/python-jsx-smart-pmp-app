# Emoji reactions

Emoji reactions allow you to react to messages with fun little emoji. Any
emoji can be used as a reaction, including
[custom emoji](/help/add-custom-emoji). Reactions appear in little boxes
underneath the message.

## Add a reaction

{!message-actions.md!}

1. Click the smiley face (<i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i>) icon.

    !!! warn ""
        For messages that you've sent, click the ellipsis
        (<i class="zulip-icon ellipsis-v-solid"></i>) and then
        **Add emoji reaction**.

1. Select an emoji. Type to search, use the arrow keys, or click on an emoji
   with your mouse.

{end_tabs}

If someone has already added a reaction, you can just click or tap on it to
second the reaction.

If you'd like to add multiple reactions without closing the emoji
picker, you can hold the `Shift` key while making selections.
