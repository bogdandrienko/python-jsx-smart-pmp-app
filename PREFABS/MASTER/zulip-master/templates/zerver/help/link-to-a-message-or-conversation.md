# Link to a message or conversation

Share permanent links to messages, threads, and streams. The Zulip project
uses this feature extensively to link to Zulip conversations from our
issue tracker.

## Link to a stream or topic (web only)

{start_tabs}

1. Click on a stream or topic in the left sidebar.

1. Copy the URL from your browser's address bar.

{end_tabs}

!!! warn ""
    This works for all views, including searches.
    All URLs in Zulip are permalinks.

## Link to a specific message

{start_tabs}

{!message-actions-menu.md!}

1. Click **Link to conversation**.

{end_tabs}

The copied link will take you to the topic of the relevant message, scrolled
down to that message.
