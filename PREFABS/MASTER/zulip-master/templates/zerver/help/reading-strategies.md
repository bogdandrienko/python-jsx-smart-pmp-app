# Reading strategies

Zulip works a little bit differently than other chat platforms. Read
[streams and topics](/help/about-streams-and-topics) if you're not yet
familiar with Zulip's topics, and [why Zulip](/why-zulip) if you're
curious why we built Zulip the way we did.

We've outlined a few ways users process messages in Zulip.

## Topic by topic

This is the recommended way to read new messages, for most users. If you're
only going to learn one way to do it, this is the one.

* Use the keyboard shortcut `n` (next unread topic) to jump from topic to
  topic. You can use the arrow keys, page up/down, and Home/End to navigate
  within a topic.

* Use `p` (next unread PM) to jump from PM to PM.

* Use `r` (reply) to reply to a topic or PM.

* Use `c` (compose stream message) or `x` (compose PM) to start new
  conversations.

* Use up arrow or `Esc` to exit out of the compose box.

## Stream view

Sometimes it's useful to scroll through all the messages in a stream,
especially in situations where you just want a general idea of what's going
on.

* Click on a stream name in the left sidebar, and scroll using your mouse,
  the arrow keys, `End`, or page up/down.

* Click on a topic to narrow to messages from that topic.

You can also get to a stream with `q` (stream search), by clicking on the
magnifying glass next to `STREAMS`, or by using the autocomplete in
[search](/help/search-for-messages).

## All messages

If you're all caught up, it can be useful to have a single place to keep
track of all messages coming in.

* Click on **All messages** in the upper left, or hit `Esc`.

* You can use `s` (narrow to stream) or `S` (narrow to topic) to zoom in,
  and `Esc` to get back to All messages.

## Starring messages for later

You can [star messages](/help/star-a-message) that you've seen and would
like to reply to later.
