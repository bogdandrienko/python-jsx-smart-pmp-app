# Delete a topic

{!admin-only.md!}

We generally recommend against deleting topics, but there are a few
situations in which it can be useful:

* Clearing out test messages after setting up an organization.

* Clearing out messages from an overly enthusiastic bot.

* Managing abuse.

In most other cases, [renaming a topic](/help/rename-a-topic) is often a
better idea, or just leaving the topic as is. Deleting a topic can confuse
users who come to the topic later via an email notification.

Note that deleting a topic also deletes every message with that topic,
whereas [deleting a stream](/help/delete-a-stream) does not.

### Delete a topic

{start_tabs}

1. Hover over the topic in the **left sidebar**.

1. Click the ellipsis (<i class="zulip-icon ellipsis-v-solid"></i>).

1. Click **Delete all messages in `<topic>`**.

1. Click **Delete messages**.

{end_tabs}

Note that deleting the last message with a particular topic also deletes
that topic.
