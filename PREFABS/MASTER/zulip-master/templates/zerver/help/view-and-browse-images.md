# View and browse images

When someone pastes or attaches an image to a message, Zulip shows a small
preview. Click on the image preview to open the **image viewer**.

In the image viewer, you can:

* View the image at **full size**
* **Download** the image
* **Pan and zoom**
* **Browse other images** in the current view. For example, if you're in a
  stream view, the image browser will show all the images from that stream. If
  you do a [search](/help/search-for-messages), the image browser will show
  all images in messages that matched that search.

Exit the image viewer by clicking anywhere outside the image.

    Use `v` to **open** the image viewer. Use `Z` and `z`
    zoom in and out of the image. Use `v` or `Esc` to **close**.

## Troubleshooting

To open the image viewer, you must click on the image preview, not the file name.
