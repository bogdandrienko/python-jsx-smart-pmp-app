# Import from Slack

Starting with Zulip 1.8, Zulip supports importing data from Slack,
including users, channels, messages, attachments, avatars, custom
emoji, and emoji reactions.

This tool has been used to import Slack workspaces with 10,000 members
and millions of messages. If you're planning on doing an import much
larger than that, or run into performance issues when importing,
[contact us](/help/contact-support) for help.

**Note:** You can only import a Slack workspace as a new Zulip
organization. In particular, you cannot use this tool to import from Slack
into an existing Zulip organization.

## Import from Slack

First, export your data from Slack.

!!! warn ""
    **Note:** Only Slack owners and admins can export data from Slack.
    See Slack's
    [guide to data exports](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/201658943-Export-data-and-message-history)
    for more information.

#### Get a Slack API token.

It will be a long string starting with `xoxb-`.  It is required to
fetch data that Slack doesn't include in their data exports, like
email addresses.


{start_tabs}

1. [Create a new Slack app](https://api.slack.com/apps).

2. [Add OAuth scopes](https://api.slack.com/authentication/basics#scopes)
   to your app. We need the following 'bot token scopes':
    - `emoji:read`
    - `users:read`
    - `users:read.email`
    - `team:read`

3. [Install the app](https://api.slack.com/authentication/basics#installing)
  to your workspace. You will get an API token that you can now use to fetch
      data from your Slack workspace.

### Export your Slack data

Now, [Export your Slack data](https://my.slack.com/services/export). You will
receive a zip file `slack_data.zip`.


This step will also generate a different token starting with
`xoxe-`; you don't need it.

### Import into Zulip Cloud

Email support@zulip.com with `slack_data.zip`, the Slack API token
generated above, and your desired subdomain. Your imported organization will
be hosted at `<subdomain>.zulipchat.com`.

If you've already created a test organization at
`<subdomain>.zulipchat.com`, let us know, and we can rename the old
organization first.

### Import into a self-hosted Zulip server

First
[install a new Zulip server](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/production/install.html),
skipping "Step 3: Create a Zulip organization, and log in" (you'll
create your Zulip organization via the data import tool instead).

Log in to a shell on your Zulip server as the `zulip` user. To import with
the most common configuration, run the following commands, replacing
`<token>` with the value generated above.

```
cd /home/zulip/deployments/current
supervisorctl stop all  # Stop the Zulip server
./manage.py convert_slack_data slack_data.zip --token <token> --output converted_slack_data
./manage.py import '' converted_slack_data
./scripts/restart-server
```

This could take several minutes to run, depending on how much data
you're importing.  The server stop/restart is only necessary when
importing on a server with minimal RAM, where an OOM kill might
otherwise occur.

**Import options**

The commands above create an imported organization on the root domain
(`EXTERNAL_HOST`) of the Zulip installation. You can also import into a
custom subdomain, e.g. if you already have an existing organization on the
root domain. Replace the last line above with the following, after replacing
`<subdomain>` with the desired subdomain.

```
./manage.py import <subdomain> converted_slack_data
```

## Caveats

- Slack doesn't export private channels or direct messages unless you pay
  for Slack Plus or contact Slack support. See
  [Slack's documentation](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/204897248-Guide-to-Slack-import-and-export-tools)
  for more details.

- (Slack Plus import) Message edit history is currently not imported.

- Slack doesn't export user settings or organization settings, so
  you'll need to configure these manually.

- Import of [user roles](/help/roles-and-permissions):
    - Slack's `Workspace Primary Owner` and `Workspace Owner` users
    are mapped to Zulip `Organization owner` users.
    - Slack's `Workspace Admin` users are mapped to Zulip's `Organization
      administrator` users.
    - Slack's `Member` users is mapped to Zulip `Member` users.
    - Slack's `Single Channel Guest` and `Multi Channel Guest` users
    are mapped to Zulip `Guest` users.
    - Slack's `Channel creators` have no special permissions in Zulip.

- The "joined #channel_name" messages are not imported.

- Messages in threads are still imported, but they are not explicitly marked as
  to be in a thread.
