# Disable new login emails

By default, Zulip sends an email whenever you log in to Zulip. These emails
help you protect your account; if you see a login email at a time or from a
device you don't recognize, you should
[change your password](/help/change-your-password) right away.

In typical usage, these emails are sent infrequently, since all Zulip apps
(web, mobile, desktop, and terminal) keep you logged in to any organization
you've interacted with in the last 1-2 weeks.

However, there are situations (usually due to corporate security policy) in
which you may have to log in every day, and where getting login emails can
feel excessive.
