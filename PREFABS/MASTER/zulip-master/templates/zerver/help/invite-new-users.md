# Invite new users

There are a number of ways to grant access to your Zulip organization;
the article below describes each in more detail.

* Allow **anyone to join** without an invitation.

* Allow people to join based on the **domain** of their email address.

* Send **email invitations**.

* Share a **reusable invitation link**.

The last two, invite-based, techniques also allow you to control the
[role (owner, admin, member, or guest)](/help/roles-and-permissions) that the
invited people will have.

You can also manage access by
[controlling how users authenticate](/help/configure-authentication-methods)
to Zulip.  For example, you could allow anyone to join without an
invitation, but require them to authenticate via LDAP.

## Enable email signup

{start_tabs}

{tab|restrict-by-email-domain}

Before anyone joins your organization this way, we'll send a validation link
to verify their email address.

## Send invitations

By default, organization admins and members can send
invitations. Organization admins can also change who can send invitations.

Note that on most Zulip servers (including Zulip Cloud), email invitations
and reusable invitation links expire 10 days after they are sent.

{relative|gear|invite}

1. Enter a list of email addresses.

1. Decide whether the users should join as [admins, members, or
   guests](/help/roles-and-permissions).

1. Select which streams they should join. If you send invitations often, you
   may want to configure a set of
   [default streams](/help/set-default-streams-for-new-users).

1. Click **Invite**.

!!! warn ""
    * You will only see **Invite users** in the gear menu if you have
    permission to invite users.

    limit and want to invite more users.

   and invitation links, or **Resend** email invitations.
