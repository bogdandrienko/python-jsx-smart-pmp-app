# Joining a Zulip organization

By default, Zulip organizations require an invitation to join.

Organization administrators can also allow anyone to join without an
invitation, and/or restrict user email addresses to a company domain. See
[inviting new users](/help/invite-new-users).

## Check if you need an invitation to join

1. Go to the Zulip URL of the organization.

1. Click **Sign up** at the top of the screen.

1. If you see a sign up form, invitations are not required! Otherwise, the
  page will say that you need an invitation to join.

## Check if you need an email from a specific domain

   error message to that effect.

## Accept an invitation

Invitations to Zulip organizations often come by email. Look for an email
from Zulip. It may take a few minutes for the invitation email to reach your
inbox.

Alternatively, an organization administrator may have sent you an invitation
link via another method.

## Tips

* If you are joining multiple Zulip organizations, we recommend
  using the [Zulip Desktop app](../apps). The desktop app makes it easy to
  [switch between different organizations](/help/switching-between-organizations).

* If your company uses single sign-on (SSO) authentication for Zulip,
  these instructions may not apply. Try going to your company's Zulip URL
  to see if there are instructions there; otherwise contact your manager
  or IT department for company-specific instructions.
