# Restrict user group management

{!admin-only.md!}

By default, all [Members](/help/roles-and-permissions) in a Zulip
organization can create [user groups](/help/user-groups) and manage
those they are a member of.  However, you can change your
organization's settings to only allow administrators to create and
manage user groups.

### Change who can create and manage user groups

{start_tabs}

{settings_tab|organization-permissions}

2. Under **Other permissions**, configure **Who can create and manage user groups**.

{!save-changes.md!}

{end_tabs}
