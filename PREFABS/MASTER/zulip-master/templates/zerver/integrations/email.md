You can send emails to Zulip! This is useful:

* If you have an email that you want to discuss on Zulip
* For mirroring mailing list traffic
* For integrating a third-party app that can send emails, but which does not
  easily lend itself to more direct integration

Instructions are available [here](/help/message-a-stream-by-email).
