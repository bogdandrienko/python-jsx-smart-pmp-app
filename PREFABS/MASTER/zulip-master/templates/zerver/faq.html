                    Do you have special plans for open source projects,
                    non-profits, groups of friends, and other non-commercial
                    entities?
                </div>
                <p class="answer">
                    Yes! Zulip Cloud Standard is free for open source
                    projects; we're proud to fully sponsor hundreds of
                    worthy organizations.  We also offer steep discounts (usually
                    85%-100%) to many non-profits, educational
                    institutions, groups of friends, and in other
                    scenarios where most of the users are not fulltime
                    employees of the customer. Generally, only closed
                    organizations that also pay their members’
                    salaries pay full price.

                    Guests cannot see or join streams they are not invited
                    to. Guests subscribed to more than 1 stream are billed
                    like regular users. Guests subscribed to a single stream
                    are generally free, unless you have more than 5 times as
                    many single-stream guests as paying users. More details

                    should the organization purchase a paid plan or
                    get Zulip Cloud Standard free because they are an
