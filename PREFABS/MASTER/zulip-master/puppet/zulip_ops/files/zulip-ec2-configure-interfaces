'''Configure a host for EC2-VPC dynamically assigned network interfaces

Amazon VPC gives us a good deal of flexibility compared to classic EC2.
However there are limitations; you can assign multiple IPs to a host
yet only the first IP per interface will be DHCP assigned, and you are
limited in the total number of interfaces you have, so doing one-IP-per-
interface is also untenable.

This script grabs the metadata provided by AWS and uses it to correctly
configure all available network interfaces.

It is suitable to be hooked in to system boot and network
reconfiguration scripts.

Note that it currently does not handle the deconfiguration of
interfaces.
