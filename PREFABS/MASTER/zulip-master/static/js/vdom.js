        The update method allows you to continually
        update a "virtual" representation of your DOM,
        and then this method actually updates the
        real DOM using jQuery.  The caller will pass
        in a method called `replace_content` that will replace
        the entire html and a method called `find` to
        find the existing DOM for more surgical updates.

        The first "update" will be more like a create,
        because your `old_dom` should be undefined.
        After that initial call, it is important that
        you always pass in a correct value of `old_dom`;
        otherwise, things will be incredibly confusing.

        The basic scheme here is simple:

            1) If old_dom is undefined, we render
               everything for the first time.

            2) If the keys of your new children are no
               longer the same order as the old
               children, then we just render
               everything anew.
               (We may refine this in the future.)

            3) If your key structure remains the same,
               then we update your child nodes on
               a child-by-child basis, and we avoid
               updates where the data had remained
               the same.

        The key to making this all work is that
        `new_dom` should include a `keyed_nodes` option
        where each `keyed_node` has a `key` and supports
        these methods:

            eq - can compare itself to similar nodes
                 for data equality

            render - can create an HTML representation
                     of itself

        The `new_dom` should generally be created with
        something like `vdom.ul`, which will set a
        tag field internally and which will want options
        like `attrs` for attributes.

        For examples of creating vdom objects, look at
        `pm_list_dom.js`.
