This key is generated using

$ openssl ecparam -genkey -name prime256v1 -noout -out private_key.pem

and isn't used anywhere. so, it's safe to have this checked into version control.
It is generated to avoid internal functions, for e.g. `generate_client_secret`,
of python-social-auth from failing because of a private key missing.
