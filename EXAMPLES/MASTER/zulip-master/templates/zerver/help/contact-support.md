# Contact support

General and technical support for Zulip is available through three
channels:

* [chat.zulip.org][chat-zulip-org], the Zulip development community.
  Depending on the time of day/week of your query and the complexity
  of your question, you may get complete responses immediately or up
  to a couple days later, but Zulip's threading makes it easy for us
  to reply to every thread. Please read the community conventions
  (linked above) and choose a topic when starting a conversation.
* We aim to reply to [email support](mailto:support@zulip.com)
  questions within a business day. Simple queries or requests for
  data imports generally receive faster replies.
* GitHub [server](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/new), web
  [frontend](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/new), [mobile
  app](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-mobile/issues/new), [desktop
  app](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-desktop/issues/new). If you
  aren't able to provide a clear bug report or are otherwise
  uncertain, it can be helpful to discuss in chat.zulip.org first to
  help create a better GitHub issue.
* We don't offer phone support except as part of enterprise contracts.

We love hearing feedback! Please reach out if you have feedback,
questions, or just want to brainstorm how to make Zulip work for your
organization.
