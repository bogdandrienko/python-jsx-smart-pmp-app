# Set the default language for new users

{!admin-only.md!}

Zulip has been translated or partially translated into a number of different
languages. You can see which languages Zulip supports, and help add support
for new languages on **[Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/zulip/zulip/)**.

If your organization usually uses a language other than English, you can set
a default language for new users. This setting will not affect existing
users, and new users can still
[manage their individual language setting](change-your-language).

### Set the default language for new users

{start_tabs}

{settings_tab|organization-settings}

2. Under **Default user settings**, change the **Default language**.

{!save-changes.md!}

{end_tabs}

Note that users can always send and read messages in any language, regardless
of their language setting.
