# Add custom profile fields

By default, user profiles show their name, email, date they joined, and when
they were last active. You can also add custom profile fields like country
of residence, birthday, manager, Twitter handle, and more.

Custom profile fields are always optional, and do not appear in users'
profiles until they fill them out.
