# Configure authentication methods

{!owner-only.md!}

By default, Zulip allows logging in via email/password as well as
various social authentication providers like Google, GitHub, GitLab,
and Apple. You can restrict users to logging in via only a subset of
these methods.

LDAP and various custom SSO login methods are currently restricted to
self-hosted Zulips only.  SAML authentication is supported by Zulip
Cloud but requires contacting support@zulip.com to configure it.

**Note:** If you are running your own server,
[read this](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/authentication-methods.html)
first. Server configuration is needed for several of the authentication
methods listed above.
