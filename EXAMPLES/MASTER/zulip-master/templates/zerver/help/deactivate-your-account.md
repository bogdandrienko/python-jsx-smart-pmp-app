## What happens when you deactivate an account

* Accounts are local to an organization; so deactivating a Zulip
  account in the `foo.zulipchat.com` organization will have no effect
  on any Zulip account you might have in the `bar.zulipchat.com`
  organization.

* Any bots that you maintain will be disabled.

* Deactivating your account won't delete messages you've sent or files
  you've shared. If permitted in your organization, delete content you'd
  like to remove before deactivating your account.

* You cannot register a Zulip account using the email address of a
  deactivated account in that organization. If you change your mind
  about deactivating an account, an organization administrator can
  [reactivate](/help/deactivate-or-reactivate-a-user#reactivate-a-user)
  your account at any time.

!!! warn ""
    If you are the only administrator in the organization, you cannot
    deactivate your account. You'll need to
    [add another administrator](/help/change-a-users-role) first.
