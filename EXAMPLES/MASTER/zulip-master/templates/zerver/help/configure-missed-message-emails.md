# Configure missed message emails

## Include organization name in subject line

If you belong to multiple Zulip organizations, it can be helpful to have the
name of the organization in the subject line of your missed message emails.

   **Include organization name in subject of missed message emails**.

{end_tabs}

## Hide message content

For security or compliance reasons, you may want to hide the content of your
Zulip messages from your email. Organization admins can do this at an
[organization-wide level](/help/hide-message-content-in-emails), but you can
also do this just for the messages you receive.

This setting also blocks message topics, stream names, and user names from
being sent through your email.

1. Under **Other notification settings**, toggle
   **Include message content in missed message emails**.
