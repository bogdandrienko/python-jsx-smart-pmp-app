# Disable welcome emails

{!admin-only.md!}

By default, Zulip sends two emails to new users when they join, telling them
their Zulip account details, encouraging them to download the apps, pointing
them at our new user guide, and teaching them about topics.

You can disable these emails if they don't make sense for your organization.

### Disable welcome emails

{start_tabs}

{settings_tab|organization-settings}

1. Under **Notifications**, toggle
   **Send emails introducing Zulip to new users**.
