# Community topic edits

{!admin-only.md!}

By default, anyone can edit any message topic. This is useful because it
allows the community to keep conversations organized, even if some members
are still learning how to use topics effectively. Note that non-admin members
cannot edit topic of a message after 3 days even if community topic editing
is enabled.

Organization administrators can turn off community topic editing. Note that
users may still be able to edit the topic of messages with **(no topic)**; see
the full article on [message and topic editing](/help/configure-message-editing-and-deletion)
for details.

### Change who can edit topics
