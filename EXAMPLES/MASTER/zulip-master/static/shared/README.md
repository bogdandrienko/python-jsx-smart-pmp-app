The files in this subtree are part of the Zulip web frontend,
and are also incorporated by the Zulip mobile app.

Note that the deployment cycles are different:

 * In the webapp, this code is deployed in the same way as the rest of
   the web frontend: it's part of the server tree, and the browser
   gets it from the server, so the client is always running the same
   version the server just gave it.

 * In the mobile app, this code is deployed in the same way as the
   rest of the mobile app: it's bundled up into the app binary which
   is uploaded to app stores and users install on their devices.  The
   client will be running the version built into their version of the
   mobile app, which may be newer, older, or simply different from the
   version on the server.

   The mobile app always refers to a specific version of this code;
   changes to this code will appear in the mobile app only after a
   commit in the mobile app pulls them in.
