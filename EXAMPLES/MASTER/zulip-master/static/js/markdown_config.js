/*
    This config is in a separate file for partly
    tactical reasons.  We want the webapp to
    configure this one way, but we don't want to
    share this code with mobile.

    I also wanted to make some diffs clear before
    doing any major file moves.

    Also, I want the unit tests for Markdown to
    be able to reuse this code easily (and therefore
    didn't just put this in ui_init.js).

    Once the first steps of making Markdown be a
    shared library are complete, we may tweak
    the file organization a bit.

    Most functions here that are looking up data
    follow the convention of returning `undefined`
    when the lookups fail.
