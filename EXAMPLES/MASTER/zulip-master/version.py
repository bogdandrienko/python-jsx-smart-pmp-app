# * adding a dependency only requires a minor version bump;
# * removing a dependency requires a major version bump;
# * upgrading a dependency requires a major version bump, unless the
#   upgraded dependency is backwards compatible with all of our
#   historical commits sharing the same major version, in which case a
#   minor version bump suffices.
